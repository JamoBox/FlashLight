FlashLight
==========
Android flashlight app
This is a very simple flashlight application for Android devices with LED camera flashes. The app is very lightweight and tries to focus on minimal storage space and memory usage over pages and pages of options and configurations.
Touch the button once, and your light is on. Once again, and the light is off. Simple.


### Requirements
This app requires the device to have an LED flash parameter for the camera.


###Permissions
This app accesses camera data, in order to obtain the properties needed for the flash to work.


###Install
This application should work without errors on devices running android 2.2 and onwards. To install, ensure your "Install from Unkown Sources" option is checked:
<code>Settings -> Security -> Device Administration -> Unknown sources</code>

Then, simply put the FlashLight.apk file somewhere accessible from your phone (SD Card, DropBox, Google Drive, etc) and click on the file from your device. It should then begin to install.
